The SMIS Tech Refresh project involved seamlessly migrating the SMIS legacy application infrastructure platform from physical servers to VM servers, showcasing the team's meticulous planning and execution skills. Additionally, the project included upgrading Oracle Fusion Middleware Software, including Oracle BPM, to the latest version, as the existing version was approaching its end-of-life. The team expertly managed the entire upgrade process, ensuring a smooth transition. This accomplishment highlights their proficiency in handling complex technological tasks. Furthermore, the team expanded the production capacity by incorporating five additional servers, significantly boosting the application's performance and benefiting its users and stakeholders.
In addition to the SMIS Tech Refresh, the SMIS application development team achieved another milestone by successfully releasing MVP 1 for the SMIS Proactive Workflow and Language Translation Request Tool. Previously, the SMIS Application solely focused on workflows triggered when servicemember customers approached the bank for SCRA benefits. With the addition of the proactive workflow, the SMIS application now efficiently manages proactive requests, which undergo QC review within the application. Notably, the SMIS proactive workflow is the first of the five workflows developed entirely on the SMIS 2.0 platform, incorporating built-in cloud-native features and deployed on Wells Fargo's internal cloud platform.
Furthermore, the team successfully developed a Language Translation Request Tool (LTRT) as part of the embedded IT remediation efforts. This application was created from scratch within a tight timeline, replacing the existing SharePoint application scheduled for retirement in Q2-2023. The new LTRT application adheres to enterprise application development guidelines, incorporates built-in cloud-native features, and will be deployed on Wells Fargo's internal cloud platform. The LTRT application will be utilized by the Internal Language Customer Experience (ILCE) team to track and manage enterprise translation needs.
The successful completion of these projects within a short span of time is a testament to the team's exceptional collaboration, technical expertise, and unwavering commitment to delivering excellence. Their efforts have resulted in improved application performance, enhanced workflows, and streamlined language translation management, benefiting both internal teams and the organization as a whole.
