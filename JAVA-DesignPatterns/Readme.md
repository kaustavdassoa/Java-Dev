* [Decorator Design pattern](#decorator-design-pattern)


## Decorator Design pattern
The Decorator Pattern proposes a solution to modify an object in run time, applying independent features or behaviors which can be combined and accumulated in any order.
Itâ€™s an elegant solution to avoid procedural code and use SOLID concepts, resulting in scalable, maintainable and clean implementation.
###### When to use decorator pattern
decorator pattern is most sutited for the following scenarios

* Several conditions to apply different behaviors/features to an object (usually done by utility imperative methods).
* Class explosion being used to combine variations of an object. For Example : When performing text formating, instead of having  TextBold, TextItalic, TextUnderline, TextBoldAndItalic, TextBoldAndUnderline, TextBoldAndItalicAndUnderline method have a decorator pattern implemented 
* One or more attributes that during a process are modified in a chained or accumulative way.
* An object with Boolean flags being used to apply modifications on the object itself.
