## Decorator Design pattern
The Decorator Pattern proposes a solution to modify an object in run time, applying independent features or behaviors which can be combined and accumulated in any order.
Itâ€™s an elegant solution to avoid procedural code and use SOLID concepts, resulting in scalable, maintainable and clean implementation.
##### When to use Decorator pattern
Decorator pattern is most sutited for the following scenarios

* Several conditions to apply different behaviors/features to an object (usually done by utility imperative methods).
* Class explosion being used to combine variations of an object. For Example : When performing text formating, instead of having  TextBold, TextItalic, TextUnderline, TextBoldAndItalic, TextBoldAndUnderline, TextBoldAndItalicAndUnderline method have a decorator pattern implemented 
* One or more attributes that during a process are modified in a chained or accumulative way.
* An object with Boolean flags being used to apply modifications on the object itself.




## Strategy Design pattern
In Strategy pattern, a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time. This type of design pattern comes under behavior pattern.

##### Strategy Design pattern
Strategy Desing pattern are suited for the following scenarios during development , desing and in refactoring phase.

* Switch/Elseif structures being used to decide the execution of specific algorithms/responsibility or complex/large code.
* Alternations between several implementations of same interface during a process execution.
* Two or more implementations of same interface used in same process, which is determinate by some external parameter.
